## 2025-07-07 part B

### Major Feature: Glass Localization & Element API Documentation Overhaul

**NEW**: Built comprehensive documentation for the Glass Localization system and Element API, plus a bulletproof test suite that actually works

_Finally got around to documenting this beast properly. Turns out writing docs is almost as fun as building the thing itself. Almost._

#### Glass Localization Documentation (`docs/GlassLocalization.md`):

- **Foundation-Driven Architecture**: Documented the three-layer system (Foundation → Module → Element) with proper inheritance
- **Three Field Types**: Detailed `glassLocaleString`, `glassLocaleText`, and `glassLocaleRichText` with their specific use cases
- **Composable Design**: Explained how fields can be mixed and matched for maximum flexibility
- **Real-World Examples**: Added practical examples showing how to use each field type in different scenarios
- **Migration Guide**: Included step-by-step instructions for upgrading from the old system

#### Element Schema Documentation:

- **Casting System Deep Dive**: Documented the visual positioning and styling system that makes non-developers actually useful
- **Schema Architecture**: Explained the modular organization and how everything fits together
- **API Integration**: Covered how schemas work with the Element API for seamless content management

#### Element API System Built:

- **RESTful CRUD Operations**: Built complete API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting elements
- **Authentication & Security**: Integrated NextAuth with proper session handling and role-based access control
- **Rate Limiting System**: Implemented robust rate limiting to prevent API abuse (because some people can't help themselves)
- **Request Validation**: Built comprehensive validation for all incoming requests with proper error responses
- **Response Standardization**: Consistent JSON responses with proper status codes and error messages
- **Bulk Operations**: Added support for bulk element operations because sometimes you need to move fast
- **Search & Filtering**: Built search endpoints with filtering capabilities for finding specific elements
- **Asset Management**: Integrated with asset handling for images, videos, and other media files

#### API Endpoints Created:

- **`/api/elements/`**: Main CRUD operations for all element types
- **`/api/elements/[type]/[id]`**: Type-specific element operations with proper validation
- **`/api/elements/bulk/`**: Bulk operations for efficient batch processing
- **`/api/elements/search/`**: Search and filtering capabilities
- **`/api/assets/[type]/[id]`**: Asset management for media files
- **`/api/content/elements/`**: Content-specific element operations
- **`/api/content/portfolio/[slug]`**: Portfolio-specific content management
- **`/api/content/pages/[slug]`**: Page content management with dynamic routing

#### Element API Documentation:

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Documented all CRUD operations with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- **Authentication & Security**: Covered NextAuth integration, rate limiting, and proper error handling
- **Request/Response Examples**: Added real-world examples showing exactly what to send and what you'll get back
- **Error Handling**: Documented all possible error scenarios and how to handle them gracefully

#### Bulletproof Test Suite (`vitest/`):

- **Unit Tests**: Mocked everything properly - Sanity client, NextAuth, rate limiting - because real APIs are for production
- **Integration Tests**: Gated behind environment flags to hit real Sanity datasets when you actually want to test
- **Authentication Tests**: Proper session handling, role-based access, and security validation
- **Rate Limiting Tests**: Because apparently some people think hammering APIs is a good idea
- **Request Validation**: Tests for malformed requests, missing fields, and invalid data types
- **Response Structure**: Ensures the API actually returns what it promises
- **Error Handling**: Tests for all the ways things can go wrong (and they will)

#### Test Infrastructure:

- **Shared Mocks**: Consolidated all mocks into `vitest/setup.ts` because DRY isn't just a principle, it's a lifestyle
- **Test Utilities**: Built `buildNextRequest()` helper because typing out request objects is about as fun as watching paint dry
- **Type Safety**: Tightened up helper typings because TypeScript should actually catch errors, not just suggest them
- **Sample Data**: Added realistic test documents because testing with fake data is like debugging with a blindfold

#### Code Quality Improvements:

- **Linting**: Everything passes prettier and lint because messy code is like showing up to a party in sweatpants
- **Build System**: Added proper test scripts to package.json because running tests should be as easy as `npm test`
- **Documentation**: Updated README with testing instructions because apparently some people need to be told how to run tests

#### What This Actually Means:

Developers can now:

- **Understand the system** without having to read through 50 different files
- **Test with confidence** knowing the test suite actually validates real functionality
- **Debug effectively** with proper error messages and validation
- **Deploy safely** with comprehensive test coverage and proper error handling
- **Onboard new team members** without the traditional "figure it out yourself" approach

The system is now production-ready with proper documentation, comprehensive testing, and developer-friendly tooling. Because apparently that's what "enterprise-grade" actually means.

_And yes, I'm aware that documenting your code is supposed to be done as you write it. But where's the fun in that?_

### Major Feature: Schema Architecture Restructuring

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Complete reorganization of Sanity schema structure with enhanced functionality and modular organization

_Finally organized this mess instead of letting it rot in a pile of spaghetti. Color me impressed._

#### New Element Schemas Added:

- **`element3D.ts`**: 3D model viewer supporting GLB, GLTF, OBJ formats with camera controls and performance options
- **`elementAudio.ts`**: Audio player with autoplay, controls, loop, and muted functionality _(Because nothing says "professional portfolio" like autoplaying audio)_
- **`elementCanvas.ts`**: Canvas element for embedding HTML canvas content with responsive sizing
- **`elementDivider.ts`**: Divider element with multiple styles (solid, dashed, dotted, custom SVG) and spacing controls _(Finally, a way to separate content without it looking like I drew it)_
- **`elementWidget.ts`**: Widget element for API integrations (currently GitHub) with refresh intervals

#### New Module Schemas Added:

- **`moduleDynamicBackground.ts`**: Dynamic background module with dot grid patterns, performance configurations, and blend modes
- **`moduleImage.ts`**: Image-focused module with casting variables for content management
- **`moduleTextBlock.ts`**: Text module for headlines and body text with casting support

#### New Object Schemas and Organization:

- **`sharedCastingFields.ts`**: Centralized casting fields for positioning, styling, and layout composition
- **Video Objects**: Three separate implementations for video handling (embed, CDN, direct)
- **Module Objects**: Background configurations (`objectModuleDynamicBackgroundDotGrid.ts`) and GitHub widget (`objectModuleWidgetGithub.ts`)
- **Core Objects**: Reorganized into subdirectories (seo.ts, typography.ts, orderableDocumentList.ts, metaCoreFields.ts)
- **Glass Localization**: Moved to organized subdirectories (glassLocaleString.ts, glassLocaleText.ts, glassLocaleRichText.ts)
- **Element Objects**: Video handling objects (objectElementVideoEmbed.ts, objectElementVideoCDN.ts, objectElementVideoDirect.ts)

#### New Utility:

- **`moduleUtils.ts`**: Utility functions for module field mapping and type detection

#### Schema Organization Changes:

- **`src/lib/sanity/schemas/index.ts`**: Reorganized imports, removed legacy schemas, added new functionality
- **`src/lib/sanity/schemas/element/index.ts`**: Added new element exports (video, divider, widget, audio, 3D, canvas)
- **`src/lib/sanity/schemas/modules/index.ts`**: Added new modules, removed test module
- **`src/lib/sanity/schemas/objects/index.ts`**: Reorganized object structure and added new exports

#### Casting System Updates:

- **`elementCastingRegistry.ts`**: Added casting fields for new elements (divider, widget)
- **`moduleCastingRegistry.ts`**: Updated for new modules
- **`wingCastingRegistry.ts`**: Updated casting references

#### API and Documentation Updates:

- **`src/app/api/content/elements/route.ts`**: Added elementWidget to query list
- **`STRUCTURE.md`**: Removed form input elements, now implemented as object types within form modules

#### Files Moved to `_OLD` Directory:

- All asset schemas (model3d.ts, photo.ts, svg.ts, video.ts) _(Apparently these weren't working anyway)_
- All document schemas (about.ts, author.ts, blog.ts, category.ts, etc.)
- Page section schemas (avatarSection.ts, buttonRowSection.ts, etc.)
- Legacy utility files (autoGeneration.ts, castingUtils.ts, localization.ts) _(All probably broken)_

#### Files Completely Removed:

- **`moduleTestCasting.ts`**: Test module removed _(At least I'm cleaning up after myself)_
- **`src/lib/types/portfolio.ts`**: ResolvedSection type removed (now empty file) _(Symbolic of the previous architecture)_

#### Architectural Improvements:

- **Modular Organization**: Schemas organized into logical subdirectories (core/, glass/, element/, module/)
- **Enhanced Media Support**: 3D models, audio, canvas, dynamic backgrounds
- **API Integration**: GitHub integration through widget elements
- **Performance Features**: Dynamic backgrounds with performance configuration
- **Cleaner Form Handling**: Object-based approach instead of individual form elements

This restructuring maintains backward compatibility while adding substantial new capabilities and improving code organization. The new architecture provides better maintainability and extensibility for future development.

_At least I didn't break everything in the process._

### Major Fix: Computed Fields System Overhaul

**FIXED**: Resolved alt text generation issues and centralized generation rules for better maintainability

#### Computed Fields Improvements:

- **Alt Text Generation Fixed**: `textSingleLine` and `textBlock` elements now generate alt text from actual `text` field content instead of fallback values
- **Centralized Generation Rules**: Moved all generation rules to `GenericComputedFieldsInput.tsx` for single source of truth
- **Removed Duplicate Logic**: Eliminated conflicting generation rules from multiple files
- **Preview Display Fixed**: Auto-generated fields now show actual content instead of generic fallbacks

#### New API & Testing:

- **`src/app/api/content/elements/`**: New API endpoint for fetching elements with computed fields
- **`src/app/test-elements/`**: Test page for validating computed fields generation
- **`src/lib/sanity/components/DisplayOnlyField.tsx`**: New display component for computed fields

#### Code Organization:

- **Moved Element Casting Registry**: Relocated `elementCastingRegistry.ts` to proper `casting/` directory
- **Removed Unused Code**: Cleaned up unused helper functions from `baseElementSchema.ts`
- **Updated Element Schemas**: All elements now use centralized generation rules

#### Technical Implementation:

- **Fixed React Hook Dependencies**: Resolved useEffect dependency warnings in computed fields component
- **Improved Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript types throughout the computed fields system
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling in computed fields generation logic

This ensures that auto-generated accessibility fields (ARIA labels, alt text) are generated from the correct source fields and display properly in the Sanity studio interface.

### Major Feature: Element Casting System Implementation

# TODO - Portfolio Project Improvements

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Massive Refactor Session)

- [x] **Core Architecture:** Migrated to a secure, server-centric model with API routes.
- [x] **Security:** Eliminated all public-facing tokens (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`). All secrets are server-side.
- [x] **Authentication:** Implemented a robust, role-based auth system with NextAuth.
- [x] **Route Protection:** Secured the `/studio` and locked content via middleware and server-side checks.
- [x] **Data Fetching:** Centralized all Sanity logic into API routes and shared library functions.
- [x] **Type Safety:** Eradicated `any` types and implemented strict TypeScript across the board.
- [x] **Image Optimization:** Replaced all `<img>` tags with the Next.js `<Image>` component.
- [x] **Component Architecture:** Re-organized components into a logical `src/components` structure.
- [x] **Build & Deployment:** Resolved all Vercel build errors, including environment variable and internal fetch issues.
- [x] **Error Handling:** Added robust `try/catch` blocks and validation to all API routes.
- [x] **Code Cleanup:** Removed over 50 legacy files and consolidated logic into a new, clean structure.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Theme Integration Session - 2025-01-20)

- [x] **Custom Font Integration:** Successfully integrated CompressaPRO-GX.woff2 font with proper @font-face declaration.
- [x] **Dynamic Theme System:** Implemented comprehensive theme switching with CSS variables and real-time updates.
- [x] **Settings Integration:** Connected all theme colors, typography, and spacing from Sanity settings to the frontend.
- [x] **Dynamic Metadata:** Updated layout to use site title, description, and favicon from Sanity settings instead of hardcoded values.
- [x] **Favicon & Logo Handling:** Fixed favicon and logo references to use actual image URLs from Sanity assets.
- [x] **Theme Toggle Component:** Created a functional theme toggle with proper accessibility and visual feedback.
- [x] **CSS Variable System:** Implemented a comprehensive CSS variable system for colors, typography, and spacing.
- [x] **Theme Test Page:** Created `/test-theme` page to verify all theme functionality is working correctly.
- [x] **Responsive Theme Application:** Updated HomePageClient and components to use dynamic theme colors.

## üìã Next Priorities

With the core architecture and theme system solid, focus can now shift to content, user experience, and testing.

### Tier 1: Core Features & Content
-   **[ ] Content Validation in Sanity:** Add validation rules to all schema types to ensure data integrity (e.g., max lengths, required fields).
-   **[ ] SEO Optimization:**
    -   ‚úÖ Dynamic SEO component using settings data (COMPLETED)
    -   **[ ] Generate a `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
-   **[ ] Sanity Studio Improvements:** Enhance the CMS interface with custom input components or previews to improve the content editing experience.
-   **[ ] Accessibility Audit:** Review the site for ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.

### Tier 2: Testing & Polish
-   **[ ] Unit & Integration Testing:** Add tests for critical components (e.g., API handlers, complex UI).
-   **[ ] Add Full Loading States:** While some exist, ensure every async operation has a clear loading state for the user.
-   **[ ] Add Full Error Boundaries:** Implement React Error Boundaries around major sections of the UI to prevent a single component crash from taking down a whole page.
-   **[ ] Mobile & Responsive Polish:** Do a full pass on all pages to ensure a perfect experience on mobile devices.

### Tier 3: Advanced Features (Future)
-   **[ ] Analytics Integration:** Add Vercel Analytics or a similar service.
-   **[ ] Working Contact Form:** Implement the backend logic for the contact form.
-   **[ ] Internationalization (i18n):** If needed, add support for multiple languages.
